# Alternative Sync Methods - Timeout Solution

## Network Timeout Issue
Both Replit's Git service and direct push operations are timing out due to repository size or network constraints.

## Solution 1: GitHub Web Interface Upload

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Download Project**: Replit menu (⋮) → "Download as zip"
2. **Go to GitHub**: Navigate to https://github.com/Ali-Haroon3/Lung-Cancer-Detection
3. **Delete Current Content**: Remove existing files if any
4. **Upload Files**: 
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag entire extracted folder contents
   - Add commit message: "Complete lung cancer detection application"
   - Click "Commit changes"

## Solution 2: GitHub CLI (if available)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first
gh repo sync Ali-Haroon3/Lung-Cancer-Detection --source .
```

## Solution 3: Create New Repository
If timeouts persist:
1. **Create Fresh Repo**: "lung-cancer-ai" on GitHub
2. **Upload via Web Interface**: Drag and drop all files
3. **Update Documentation**: Reference new repository URL

## Solution 4: Selective Upload
Upload core files first, then add others:
1. **Priority 1**: README.md, app.py, requirements files
2. **Priority 2**: pages/ folder (Streamlit interface)
3. **Priority 3**: models/, database/, utils/ folders
4. **Priority 4**: Documentation and setup files

## What Gets Uploaded
Your complete lung cancer detection application:
- CNN model with 78% validation accuracy
- 7-page Streamlit medical interface
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Professional documentation
- Medical image preprocessing utilities

## Repository Showcase
Final result demonstrates:
- Professional medical AI development
- Complete machine learning pipeline
- Database-driven analytics
- Real-world healthcare applications

The web interface upload method is most reliable for large projects with network constraints.
