# Manual GitHub Sync Guide

## Problem: Replit Git Service Error
The "Unknown error from the Git service" is a common Replit limitation. Here's how to manually sync your project.

## Quick Solution

### Method 1: Download and Push (Recommended)
1. **In Replit**: Click the menu (⋮) → "Download as zip"
2. **Extract** the zip file to your local `lung-cancer-detection` folder
3. **In your local terminal**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/lung-cancer-detection
   git add .
   git commit -m "Sync from Replit: Complete lung cancer detection app"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Method 2: Individual File Copy
If download doesn't work, copy key files manually:

**Essential Files to Copy:**
- `README.md` (project documentation)
- `app.py` (main application)
- `pages/` folder (all Streamlit pages)
- `models/` folder (CNN implementation)
- `database/` folder (PostgreSQL integration)
- `utils/` folder (preprocessing utilities)
- `.gitignore` (Git configuration)

### Method 3: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
# In your local lung-cancer-detection folder
gh repo sync owner/lung-cancer-detection --source .
```

## Verification

After successful sync, your GitHub repository should contain:
- Complete Streamlit application (7 pages)
- CNN model implementations (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet)
- PostgreSQL database schema and services
- Medical image preprocessing utilities
- Professional documentation and setup guides

## Files Ready for Sync

Your Replit project now includes:
- ✅ Professional README.md with technical documentation
- ✅ Complete medical AI application with CNN training
- ✅ Database integration with audit logging
- ✅ Proper .gitignore excluding sensitive files
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides and setup documentation

## Next Steps

1. Choose Method 1 (recommended) to download and sync
2. Verify all files appear in your GitHub repository
3. Update README.md with any additional project-specific details
4. Consider setting up GitHub Actions for automated testing (optional)

Your repository will showcase a professional medical AI application with comprehensive features and documentation.
