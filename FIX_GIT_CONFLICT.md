# üîß Fix Git Conflict - Manual Resolution

Since you committed to GitHub separately, there's a merge conflict. Here's how to fix it:

## Option 1: Force Push (Easiest)
**Use this if you want to overwrite GitHub with your current local changes:**

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will overwrite any changes you made directly on GitHub.

## Option 2: Pull and Merge (Safest)
**Use this to keep both your local changes and GitHub changes:**

```bash
# Pull the remote changes first
git pull origin main

# If there are conflicts, Git will tell you which files need manual editing
# Edit the conflicted files to resolve conflicts
# Then add and commit the merged changes
git add .
git commit --author="Ali-Haroon3 <aliharoon643@gmail.com>" -m "Resolve merge conflicts and update dependencies"
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Fresh Start
**If things get too complicated, start fresh:**

```bash
# Backup your current changes
cp -r . ../backup-lung-cancer-detection

# Reset to match GitHub exactly
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# Re-apply your dependency fixes
# Copy back the fixed files:
# - requirements_streamlit.txt
# - runtime.txt
# - render.yaml

git add .
git commit --author="Ali-Haroon3 <aliharoon643@gmail.com>" -m "Fix Python and dependency compatibility for Render"
git push origin main
```

## What Files Were Fixed
These files have the Render deployment fixes:
- ‚úÖ `requirements_streamlit.txt` - Updated Python packages
- ‚úÖ `runtime.txt` - Python 3.11.9 specification  
- ‚úÖ `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
- ‚úÖ `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Updated deployment guide

## After Resolving Git Issues
Once you push successfully, Render will automatically redeploy with the fixed dependencies and your app should work!

**Recommended:** Use Option 1 (force push) if you want to keep your current local changes and overwrite GitHub.
