# Fix Streamlit Cloud Deployment Issues

## Issue 1: TensorFlow Installation Error
The TensorFlow version conflict has been fixed with compatible versions in `requirements_streamlit.txt`.

## Issue 2: Wrong Main File
Streamlit Cloud tried to use `streamlit_app.py` instead of `app.py`.

## ðŸ”§ Fix and Redeploy

### Step 1: Push Updated Requirements
```bash
git add requirements_streamlit.txt requirements_lite.txt STREAMLIT_CLOUD_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix Streamlit Cloud deployment issues

- Update TensorFlow to compatible version 2.15.0
- Fix all dependency versions for Streamlit Cloud
- Add lightweight requirements as backup
- Use opencv-python-headless for cloud deployment"

git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Update Streamlit Cloud Configuration
In your Streamlit Cloud app:

1. **Go to App Settings** (gear icon)
2. **Change Main File**: Set to `app.py` (not streamlit_app.py)
3. **Set Requirements File**: Use `requirements_streamlit.txt`
4. **Reboot App**

### Step 3: Alternative - Create New App
If the current app is stuck:

1. **Delete Current App** in Streamlit Cloud
2. **Create New App**:
   - Repository: `Ali-Haroon3/Lung-Cancer-Detection`
   - Branch: `main`
   - **Main file**: `app.py`
   - **Requirements file**: `requirements_streamlit.txt`

## ðŸ“¦ Dependency Fixes Applied

- âœ… TensorFlow 2.15.0 (compatible with Streamlit Cloud)
- âœ… opencv-python-headless (cloud-optimized)
- âœ… Fixed numpy version compatibility
- âœ… All dependencies pinned to working versions

## ðŸ›  Backup Plan

If TensorFlow still fails, use `requirements_lite.txt` which includes:
- tensorflow-cpu==2.13.0 (lighter version)
- All other dependencies remain the same

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After fixing these issues:
- App builds successfully
- All pages load correctly
- Model training works (may be slower with CPU TensorFlow)
- Database integration functions
- Predictions work with pre-trained model

The deployment should complete successfully within 5 minutes after applying these fixes.
